# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
location = Location.create(name: 'Miguel')
location = Location.create(city: 'Torrejon')
location = Location.create(street: 'Estajo')
location = Location.create(zip: '28850')
location = Location.create(country: 'Spain')
